If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?:
To get an idea of the person's 'aura' I took all the measurable traits using a query SELECT AVG(danceability), AVG(energy), AVG(loudness), AVG(speechiness), AVG(valence), AVG(tempo) FROM songs;
From this I can conclude they don't like excessively loud music, They tend to like more dancable music, energetic and fast paced music.
From the descriptions in the spotify article, I'd describe them as the 'Purple aura'





Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?:
The problem with calculating it from only looking at the highest average value is a lack of nuance.
In the spotify article they explain they determine a users 'aura' from a pool of 6 possibilities.
Since each song in the database has 3 values 'valence', 'energy' and 'danceability' you could quite simply average out these 3 values and compare them to the average of other users in a larger database.
If you assigned an aura two the order of the two highest values, you would have a possibility of 6 different outcomes as seen below:
Aura 1: Valence > Energy,
Aura 2:Energy > Valence,
Aura 3: Valence > Danceability,
Aura 4: Danceability > Valence,
Aura 5: Energy > Danceability,
Aura 6: Danceability > Valence
