Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
The least likely teams to win shrank all the way to 0.0% as the number of simulations increased.
This is not correct, as there would always be a chance for them to win, however small.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO
I would choose 1000 simulations. Jumping to 10.0000 increases the time significantly.
Furthermore it seems to become inaccurate when exceeding amount of simulations, as it pushes the least likely to win teams to 0% chance.
